### About

I discovered creative coding in summer 2017 and been publishing my javascript experiments on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ScavengerFrontend) since. Interactive SVG was my favorite medium of expression back then. <br/> In 2019 I started to teach myself realtime 3D: threejs / webgl and glsl shaders. I was amazed by the endless possibilites of these tools. I learned to think in visual 3D forms and narratives, a very rewarding process to me as a creative person. <br/>
Around summer 2021 I dove deep into generative art, combining all the things I've learned so far.. and the rest is history.
<br/>
I'm on my journey of making infinite versions of weird, poignant, playful and memorable visuals.
