# ★ Hello, stranger and code art lover ★ <br/>

I'm Anna, a Creative Coder focused on visual 3D / 2D experiences and interactivity on the Web. </br> I enjoy making beautiful things at the intersection of art and technology. <br/>

### I improvise with

js / svg / threejs / webgl / glsl shaders

### I'm good at

code art + generative art + interactive storytelling

### About my art

I love to express myself through code. I discovered creative coding in summer 2017 and been publishing my javascript experiments on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ScavengerFrontend) since. Interactive SVG was my favorite medium of expression back then. <br/> In autumn 2019 I started to teach myself realtime 3D: threejs/webgl and glsl shaders. I was amazed by the endless possibilites of these tools. I learned to think about code art in visual 3D narratives, a very rewarding process to me as a creative person. <br/>
Around summer 2021 I dove deep into generative art, combining all the things I've learned so far.. and the rest is story.
<br/>
I'm on my journey of making infinite versions of weird, playful and surreal worlds. 
<br/>
At the heart of everything I make lies color, form, relationship between 2D and 3D and a meaningful narrative. My deep desire is to understand all these terms through constant exploration.

### My background & influences

I've been drawing and creating for as long as I can remember, it’s a core part of me. I also studied applied computer science, been a math teacher, sometimes if I'm lucky (usually by night) I experiment with traditional painting, illustration, paper sculpture.. <br/>
I also love taking long walks around the city, trying to be a good observer of the world around me. It all influences my code art.<br/><br/>
I just love to create stuff.
